A decade of European military interventions in Mali is starting to unravel.
Last week, the military government in the capital Bamako ordered Danish soldiers to leave immediately.
Now it has expelled the French ambassador to Mali, after France’s foreign minister called the ruling generals “illegitimate and out of control”.
France is considering withdrawing soldiers, and Germany’s commitment is also in doubt.
Who will fill the security void?
