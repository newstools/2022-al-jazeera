Egypt looking for record-extending eighth AFCON title
Senegal have been losing finalists twice (2002, 2019)

Hello and welcome to the final of the Africa Cup of Nations.
I’m Faras Ghani and I’ll bring you live updates from the final taking place in Cameroon’s capital Yaounde where we have Oluwashina Okeleji inside Olembe Stadium and Daniel Ekonde among the fans.

🕛 31 mins
Oluwashina, the Africa football expert at the Olembe Stadium, chips in with this:
“The half-hour mark: Senegal creating all the chances. Fit-again Watford man Ismaila Sarr probing on the right. His dangerous crosses across goal not met by any Teranga Lion.”
Senegal 0-0 Egypt

🕛 28 mins
Salah has a first shot on target.. in the 28th minute. Egypt has had 43% of possession and need him to be more involved.
Don’t forget, the Liverpool man (one of them) has been involved in three of Egypt’s four goals at this tournament.

🕛 22 mins
Senegal on top, Egypt hanging on.
Ismaila Sarr is making his presence felt on the pitch. But are expectations taking a toll on Mane?

Mané is having a nightmare.#AFCON2021 #SENEGY #SenegalEgypt

🕛 15 mins
Senegal with the upper hand in the final so far (on possession stats). But Gabaski has kept Egypt in the game with that penalty save.
Senegal 0-0 Egypt

Mane got nervous and went for power. Senegal are playing well though.
But that Egyptian keeper is solid.

🕛 7 mins
Mane misses the penalty. Great save by Gabaski.
“Cameroon fans were screaming ‘inside the net’. But it’s SAVED. Egypt fans celebrate, Senegalese fans in shock,” says Oluwashina seated inside Olemebe Stadium.
Senegal 0-0 Egypt

🕛 3 mins
PENALTY to Senegal.

A moment of silence for the eight who lost their lives last month in a crush outside this very stadium.
Senegal get the AFCON final underway from left to right.

The closing ceremony is out of the way, President Biya is in the house, Senegal is winning the Twitter poll and the players are on the pitch for the national anthems.
Less than 10 minutes to go.

Senegal to win, then? That’s what you lot said in our Twitter poll: 👇

A certain Mo Salah, who has been involved in three of the four goals Egypt have scored in this tournament, needs to get his followers voting!

1 hour ago (18:20 GMT)
Our man Oluwashina at the ground says “Senegal’s goal-keeper Mendy is out for his warm-up and he’s got the fans out of their seats. Clearly the home fans are all for Senegal. After Egypt knocked Cameroon out in the semis, it’s clear who they are supporting today.”

Reminder: Both these sides lost the last time they were in an AFCON final.
Senegal lost to Algeria in 2019 while Egypt were beaten by Cameroon in 2017.

Egypt plays attractive football but I give this one to Mane and Co.

Oluwashina chips in with this: “Stadium erupts into a wild applause as Cameroon’s President Paul Biya arrives with his wife.”
Imagine the scenes if the home side was still in the tournament.

A history lesson
Here are the past AFCON winners. Egypt, as you can see, are called Pharaohs for a reason.

Oluwashina is seated comfortably inside Olembe Stadium and is, umm, enjoying the view.
“Police, firefighters, naval and airforce officers, the army, Gendarmeries, national guard, and others… they’ve been standing there for three hours,” he says.
Mind you, he had to walk four miles to get to the stadium.
“Closure of roads six hours before kick-off with police lining up the streets,” he adds.
Still more than 90 minutes until kick-off.

Here’s Daniel among some Senegalese supporters who have gathered outside the embassy in Bastos, Yaounde, as they wait for buses to take them to the stadium.
Seems we will have a decent Senegalese turnout at Olembe Stadium.

Route to the final
Neither side came out all guns blazing at the start of the tournament.
Egypt managed just two goals in their three group matches, edging out Guinea-Bissau and Sudan with 1-0 scorelines after losing their tournament opener 1-0 to Nigeria.
Senegal had two stalemates against Guinea and Malawi that followed a 1-0 win over Zimbabwe in the opener.
But both sides picked up pace from there on.

What you need to know about the AFCON final
Egypt will be looking for a record-extending eighth AFCON title. Senegal will be looking to go one better after losing the 2019 final to Algeria.
The final will also see one of world football’s most exciting attacking duos facing off against each other as Mohamed Salah leads Egypt against a Senegal side spearheaded by Sadio Mane.
The match is being played at Yaounde’s Olembe Stadium, where eight people were killed in a crush on January 25 – a tragedy that has overshadowed the tournament in Cameroon.
Here’s what you need to know about the final.
