Kholofelo Sethebe was first drawn to the sea as a child, on a visit to Cape Town from her landlocked home province in South Africa.
But traditional fears of the ocean were deep, so it is only now, as a qualified marine biologist, that she is teaching herself to swim.
She Saw the Sea, an uplifting film by Karin Slater, follows the vivacious Kholofelo as she braves the ocean to find a beautiful new underwater world.
