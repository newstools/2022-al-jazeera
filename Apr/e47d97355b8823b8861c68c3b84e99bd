Right, Qatar will take on Ecuador on November 21, that’s confirmed.
It will be a while before we know the teams for the December 18 game… that’s the World Cup final.
Until then, stay safe and give our World Cup Qatar 2022 draw wrap a read.
Thanks for joining us… I’ll be humming Hayya Hayya all night.
