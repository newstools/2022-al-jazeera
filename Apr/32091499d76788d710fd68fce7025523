Ragnimwendé Eldaa Koama is a leader who believes in self-improvement and helping young people find their own confidence to succeed.
In The Coach, by filmmaker Mamounata Nikièma, we see Eldaa at work, coaching some of Burkina Faso’s many young entrepreneurs. Communication, public speaking and confidence are vital for success. With high unemployment in Ouagadougou, many young people choose self-employment and are keen to learn from this dynamic and enterprising coach.
