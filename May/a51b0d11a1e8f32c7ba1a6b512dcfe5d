In 2010, I had to flee Ethiopia after my village was attacked. I woke up early in the morning and heard gunshots. I saw houses burning. I saw someone bleeding on the ground. I witnessed a lot of brutal violence.
In the end, I found a way out; I survived. But I ended up locked up in a refugee camp for years and years.
Now, I watch people across Europe welcoming Ukrainians fleeing the war into their homes. And I can’t help but wonder, how come no one showed me the same compassion? How come no one offered me a place to stay so that I wouldn’t be stuck in a refugee camp for a decade?
Many have argued those in the West welcomed Ukrainian refugees with open arms because they looked like them – and maybe this is true. But it does not mean it always has to be the case.
