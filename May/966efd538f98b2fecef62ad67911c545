The sudden death of longtime President Idriss Deby in April last year left a power vacuum in Chad that has led to political upheaval.
His son, army General Mahamat Idriss Deby, soon took over and promised to hold elections in 18 months after a national dialogue between the military government, opposition groups and rebel fighters.
But those discussions have been postponed for a second time.
Preliminary talks in Qatar have made little progress.
So, what could this mean for Chad’s future?
