After more than a year of delays, violence and uncertainty – Somalia is ready to vote for its next president.
The original plan was to hold a one-person one-vote election for the first time in 50 years.
But security concerns, as well as legal and financial realities make that difficult.
Instead, Somalia’s parliament will pick the president.
