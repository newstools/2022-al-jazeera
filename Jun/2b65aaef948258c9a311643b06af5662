A legacy of Belgian colonialism in central Africa – in the course of two centuries, millions of people are believed to have been killed or mutilated in what is now the modern-day Democratic Republic of Congo, including the nation’s first Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba.
The arrival of Belgium’s royal couple on their first visit to the country is being billed as a way to move forward, but with such a long list of historical grievances – many Congolese are sceptical that any real action or accountability can be achieved.
